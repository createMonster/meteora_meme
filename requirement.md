### Solana meme-pool fee-harvest strategy (no hedging)

| Phase                                       | What you do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **1 Token universe  →  shortlist**          | 1. Pull the current “Solana Meme” list from a screener (CoinGecko, Magic Eden, etc.).<br>2. Keep only coins that pass **3 filters**:<br>  • **M-cap ≥ \$200 M** → reduces blow-up risk.<br>  • **24 h volume ≥ 15 % of m-cap** → ensures constant flow for fees.<br>  • Age > 60 days & active GitHub/Twitter.                                                        | Large, liquid memes are far less likely to “go to zero overnight”, yet still swing wildly day-to-day. Example shortlist today:<br>**TRUMP, BONK, WIF, PENGU, POPCAT** – all clear the m-cap & liquidity thresholds. ([bitrue.com][1], [coingecko.com][2]) |
| **2 Volatility & fee tier match**           | Calculate 7-day realised σ from minute bars (or grab from Dune).<br>• σ < 5 % → 0.05 % fee tier (Raydium/Orca).<br>• 5 % ≤ σ < 15 % → 0.30 % tier.<br>• σ ≥ 15 % → 1.00 % tier (or Orca “adaptive fee” pools).                                                                                                                                                        | Matching the pool’s fee tier to expected volatility maximises fee-capture vs. IL (impermanent loss). Orca & Raydium both expose 0.01–1 % tiers; the 1 % tier is designed for very choppy pairs. ([academy.swissborg.com][3], [dev.orca.so][4])            |
| **3 Position sizing & range design (CLMM)** | *Portfolio level* – equal-risk budget: allocate **max 5 % of capital per pool**.<br>*Pool level* – provide two overlapping ranges per coin:<br>  **Core band**: current price ± 15 % (60 % of liquidity).<br>  **Outer band**: ± 40 % (40 %).<br>Rebalance (“range shift”) whenever mid-price exits the outer 80 % of the core band or every 7 days, whichever first. | Tight inner liquidity harvests most swaps; the outer band keeps you earning during large spikes so you don’t sit 100 % in a single asset. Using two bands avoids constant gas churn yet still rides volatility.                                           |
| **4 Automatic compounding**                 | Each rebalance:<br>1. Withdraw earned fees.<br>2. Swap 50 % to the weaker side to re-balance token ratios.<br>3. Re-deposit into fresh bands.<br>SOL tx fees are < \$0.01 so weekly cycles are cheap.                                                                                                                                                                 | Auto-compounding turns fees into more LP principal, lifting effective APR without manual tracking.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **5 Exit & risk guards**                    | • **Hard stop**: price –40 % in 24 h or 70 % drop from ATH → pull liquidity (flash-crash protection).<br>• **Liquidity drain**: on-chain depth < 30 % of 14-day average.<br>• **Social activity collapse** (> 50 % drop in X/Twitter volume) – early warning to exit before vols dry up.                                                                              | You still face IL, but these rules take you out before the classic meme “rug-pull”.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **6 Tool stack (all no-code friendly)**     | • **Data**: Jupiter API (price), Dune dashboard (vol/σ), Birdeye alerts.<br>• **Deployment**: Orca “Whirlpool” UI or Meteora vaults for hands-off vaults.<br>• **Automation**: Hummingbot CLMM strategy script + cronjob; or Helix Automations to call “shiftRange()” on-chain.                                                                                       | Entire workflow can run from one inexpensive VPS; no need for off-chain hedging venues.                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### Why this works

* **Fee farming > directional bet** – In a meme sector with \~10 B \$ m-cap, 24 h DEX turnover regularly reaches 20–25 % of that cap. Even modest bands can collect annualised **100–300 % gross fees** during hype waves; IL is acceptable if you recycle earnings fast. ([coingecko.com][2])
* **Diversification of tail-risk** – Spreading across 5–6 un-correlated memes means a single crash only clips ≤ 5 % of bankroll.
* **Cheap gas, frequent tweaks** – Solana’s sub-cent fees let you tighten ranges or rotate pools far more often than on EVM chains, turning volatility into revenue instead of fear.

#### Quick start checklist

1. **Fetch candidates** with the screen above and compute σ tier.
2. **Deposit** into the recommended bands on Orca/Raydium (start test-size).
3. **Set alerts**: price ± 15 %, 24 h vol change, Twitter mentions via LunarCrush.
4. **Automate weekly runbook**: claim-swap-redeploy.
5. **Track P & L** net of IL; if net APR < 40 % on rolling 30 d → rotate to hotter meme pool.
